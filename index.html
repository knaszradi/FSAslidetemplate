      Mozilla project was created in 1998 with the release of the Netscape browser suite source code in order to “harness the creative power of thousands of programmers on the internet and fuel unprecedented levels of innovation in the browser market.” By being open, Mozilla was setting itself up to be larger than any one company and providing people around the world with different ways to get involved in the free software movement. 
      Mozilla 1.0 was released in 2002 when over 90% of Internet users were on the web with Internet Explorer with the goal of “providing the best possible browsing experience to the widest possible set of people.” 2003 – Mozilla created the Mozilla Foundation to promote openness, innovation, and opportunity on the Internet. The Mozilla Foundation releases software (such as Firefox) and supports accessibility improvements on the Web.
